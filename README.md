# Introduction
 ScrewablePartAPI adds an easy way of making parts in the game screwable.
 You will need to be already using the ModAPI by @tommojphillips
 https://github.com/tommojphillips/ModAPI
 or else it is not detectable when the part is removed/installed.
 
# Getting Started
Please look under the Github Wiki to see how to implement it
